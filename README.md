# ForgeFrame

Welcome to the **ForgeFrame** repository. This project is a highly immersive, interactive landing page built for a web design and development studio specializing in video game aesthetics and 3D web experiences. 

🌍 **[View Live Site](https://forgeframe.vercel.app/)**

The site is designed to deliver a captivating user experience through cinematic 3D elements, sophisticated scroll animations, and a seamless light/dark mode transition, reflecting the studio's focus on narrative-driven design and modern web technology.

## 🌟 Features

- **Immersive 3D Environments:** Interactive WebGL scenes powered by React Three Fiber that respond to user interactions, creating a premium visual experience.
- **Dynamic Theme Switching:** Seamless, fade-transitioned light and dark modes with customized palettes (such as deep blood-red and elegant gold).
- **Subtle Interactions & Animations:** Smooth scroll-triggered reveals, atmospheric transitions, and cinematic typography designed to not feel like "pasted text."
- **Performance Optimized:** On-demand rendering loops for 3D canvases to save battery and computational resources while maintaining maximum visual fidelity.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Asymmetric, editorial layouts combined with an engaging, dark, and slightly macabre edge perfectly suited for the gaming industry.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project utilizes a cutting edge, modern web development stack to achieve its visual goals:

- **[Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)** - The core React framework for server-side capabilities, routing, and optimization.
- **[React 19](https://react.dev/)** - For building an interactive and reactive user interface.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - For establishing the core 3D scene, lighting, materials, and camera.
- **[React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)** - A powerful React renderer for Three.js, allowing declarative, component-based 3D scenes.
- **[@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)** - A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber (like cameras, environments, and controls).
- **Vanilla CSS & CSS Modules** - For precise, custom styling, theme token management (CSS Variables), and scoped component styles without relying on heavy UI libraries.
